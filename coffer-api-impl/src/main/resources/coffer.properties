home.welcome = is a free QSAR web service that makes predictions for chemical compounds. \
It employs circular fingerprints (CFPs) and provides information to help interpreting predictions.


model.prediction.tip = Each prediction model provides a probability estimate for the prediction. \
The probability value indicates how confident the classifier is.

model.measured = Measured
model.measured.tip.some = The query compound is included in some of the training datasets. \
This is ignored when predicting the compound.
model.measured.tip.single = The query compound is included in the training dataset. \
This is ignored when predicting the compound. 

fragment.hide = small: hide super-fragments that extend smaller fragments.<br>\
all: show all fragments.<br>\
large: hide sub-fragments that are included in larger fragments.
fragment.hide.SUPER.link = small
fragment.hide.NONE.link = all
fragment.hide.SUB.link = large

compound.info.tip = PubChem and ChEMBL are accessed with the compound SMILES to provide additional information.

fragment.type.tip = The service uses filtered (instead of folded) Extended-Connectivity Fingerprint (ECFP) \
fragments as features for the prediction algorithm.  

doc.about = The CoFFer web service predicts chemical compounds and provides information to help interpreting predictions.<br>\
The QSAR models are built with circular fingerprints (CFPs). CFPs are structural fragments that are mined on the training dataset. \
This service shows that filtered (instead of folded) fingerprint fragments can yield very predictive models, \
while at the same time, contain useful information when trying to understand model predictions. Please refer to our publication for details.  
#The fragments can encode crucial information about the mode of action of a chemical compound (e.g., a fragment might be a toxicophore).

doc.filteredFragments = We selected the {http://cdk.github.io/cdk/1.5/docs/api/org/openscience/cdk/fingerprint/CircularFingerprinter.html CDK implementation} of \
{http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci100050t Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints} as circular fingerprint fragments. Instead of reducing the large amount \
of features by fingerprint folding, we applied a supervised filtering approach: the method removes redundant (non-closed) fragments as well as fragments \
that are uncorrelated to the target endpoint. Please refer to our publication for details.

doc.classifiers = The {http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka machine learning library WEKA} was used to build three types of classifiers  \
({http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/classifiers/functions/SMO.html Support Vector Machines}, \
{http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/classifiers/trees/RandomForest.html Random Forests}, \
and {http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/classifiers/bayes/NaiveBayes.html naive Bayes}). \
When making a prediction for a two class problem (e.g., with class values 'active' and 'in-active'), the models \
provide a probability estimate that expresses the confidence of the classifier. For example, a value close to 50% means that \
the classifier is very unsure about the compound activity.
  
doc.rankingFragments = Our service ranks fragments according to their importance for predicting the query compound. \
This is computed by swapping the feature value of the fragment and re-classifying the compound. \
Moreover, features are highlighted as "activating" or "de-activating":<br>\
 * A feature is marked as "activating" if it is originally present and a re-classification with swapped feature value \
leads to a lower probability of being active. Also, a feature is marked as "activating" if it was originally absent \
in the query compound and the predicted probability with swapped feature value leads to a higher active probability.<br>\
 * Otherwise, we consider the feature to be "de-activating".<br> \
 <br> \
When swapping feature values for a fragment, our method takes the compound structure into account:<br>\
 * If the evaluated fragment is originally present in a compound, its super-fragments (that extend this fragment) \
will be switched off as well when evaluating the importance of the fragment. \
Additionally, sub-fragments that are included in this fragment and do not match the compound at a different location are disabled.<br>\
 * Accordingly, if the evaluated fragment is originally absent in the compound and is switched on for evaluation, \
then all sub-fragments (that are contained within this fragment) are switched on simultaneously. Please refer to our publication for details.
 
doc.source = This open-source project is implemented in Java and mainly based on the two libraries \
{https://github.com/cdk-dsc CDK} and \
{http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka WEKA}. <br> \
Our source code is provided under AGPL license on GitHub. The main libraries are:<br>\

 * {https://github.com/kramerlab/coffer coffer} : This web service.

doc.validation = The models have been validated with a 3 times repeated, nested 10-fold cross-validation. \
The inner level of cross-validation was used for model selection (to decide on the selected algorithm, parameters and number of features). \
The outer level of cross-validation was used to estimate the predictivity of the model. \
The published models are build on the entire dataset.
 
doc.cite = A paper has been submitted to the Journal of Cheminformatics.
